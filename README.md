## Overview
Leaf-Link is a wireless sensing system designed for **environmental monitoring**. It operates **battery-free** using super-capacitors energy storage and solar energy harvesting, with adaptive power management hardware  and intelligent scheduling based on **AsTAR++ scheduler**, and communicates over **LoRaWAN**.

## Software Details

The firmware is based on **Zephyr RTOS** and integrates the **AsTAR++ scheduler** with LoRaWAN communication.

### Scheduler Parameters
- **Sensing rate:**  
  - Minimum: 2 hours  
  - Maximum (day/night): 5 minutes  
- **Voltage thresholds:**  
  - vMin = 3.9 V  
  - vOptimum = 4.15 V  
  - vMax = 5.4 V  

### LoRaWAN Configuration
- Region: EU868  
- Spreading Factor: 12  
- TX Power: 14 dBm  
- Activation: OTAA  
- Payload structure: sensor measurements (BME680), capacitor voltage and node status flags

## Results and Figures

Key results are summarised below; full sets of traces are available in the [results folder](results/).

### Message Throughput
Battery-free nodes achieved stable operation with adaptive scheduling, while battery-powered nodes stalled after deep depletion.

### Reliability
End-to-end message reliability reached 97â€“98% after server fixes.

## Failures and Limitations

In addition to node-specific issues reported in the manuscript, we list further bugs observed during deployment.

- **Software crashes:** Rare resets (<1% of total operation time) traced to LoRaWAN stack instability.  
- **Backend bug:** Initial rejection of packets with NULL SNR values caused early data loss (~3% of total packets). Fixed mid-deployment.    
- **Canopy sensitivity:** Nodes under denser canopy harvested ~30â€“40% less energy, resulting in longer duty cycles.
