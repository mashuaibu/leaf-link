## Overview
Leaf-Link is a wireless sensing system designed for **environmental monitoring**. It operates **battery-free** using super-capacitors energy storage and solar energy harvesting, with adaptive power management hardware  and intelligent scheduling based on **AsTAR++ scheduler**, and communicates over **LoRaWAN**.  

This repository contains:
- **Software design** documents  
- **Hardware designs** (schematics, wiring diagrams, etc.) 
- **Implementation and analysis docs** to reproduce the paper figures and tables
- **Deployment traces and experimental results**
